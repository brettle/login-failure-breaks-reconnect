  <h1>Demo of the login-failure-breaks-reconnect bug</h1>

  <p>If a logged in user fails in an attempt to login as a second user, then
    they will remain logged in as the first user (as expected), <em>but</em>
    if they ever reconnect, they will not be logged in again.</p>
  <p>See the browser console for output of the test.</p>
